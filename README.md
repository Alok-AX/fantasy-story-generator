This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

A brief write-up explaining design choices, challenges faced, and integration of the AI language model API for the Enchanted Storyteller.



Design Choices:
I wanted the Enchanted Storyteller to feel like stepping into a magical realm, so I chose gentle colors and fantastical images to create a captivating atmosphere. The form where users input their preferences is easy to use, like filling out a friendly questionnaire. When the story appears, it's like unwrapping a gift, with beautiful fonts and pictures that match the fantasy setting you picked.

Challenges Faced:
Getting the AI to work smoothly was tricky. It was like teaching a new spell â€“ I had to make sure the application and the AI could talk to each other correctly. Making everything look good on phones and computers of all shapes and sizes was also a puzzle, but I worked hard to make sure everything ran smoothly for everyone.

Integration of AI Language Model API:
Using the AI was a bit like having a magical assistant. I followed the instructions carefully, setting up the application to work together with the AI. I made sure it knew what to do if something went wrong, and I added special tricks to keep it running smoothly. Overall, the AI added a touch of magic to the Enchanted Storyteller, making each story feel like a special journey just for you.
